The run_analysis.R script prepare and download the data and then follows the steps as described

    Dataset is Downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

    Assigns each data to variables:
    1. features <- features.txt (from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.) 
    2. activities <- activity_labels.txt (List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its labels) 
    3. subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt (test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects)
    4. x_test <- test/X_test.txt (features test data) 
    5. y_test <- test/y_test.txt (test data of activities'ID labels) 
    6. subject_train <- test/subject_train (train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects) 
    7. x_train <- test/X_train.txt (features train data) 
    8. y_train <- test/y_train.txt (train data of activitiesâ€™ID labels)

    Merges the traing and test sets using rbind() and cbind() to create one dataset

    From the new dataset extracts only the mean and standard devaition for each measurement

    Descriptive activity names to name the activities in dataset and Replace the labels with descriptive names and correct the typos

    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject TidyData is created
