## Objective
This assignment project is from the 'John Hopkins Data Science Course : Getting and Cleaning Data'. 
This obejective of this project is to clean a raw data set using R programming language.<br> 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The link to the data set is <a herf ="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"> here</a>.
The R code should have these 5 outcomes:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Once the data set is downloaded, the data sets are in a zip file. In order to obtain the data set, unzip it.
The rest of the steps can be understood in **run_analysis.R** file.
