The run_analysis.R script prepare and download the data and then follows the steps as described

    Dataset is Downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

    -> Assigns each data to variables:
    1. features <- features.txt (from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.) 
    2. activities <- activity_labels.txt (List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its labels) 
    3. subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt (test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects)
    4. x_test <- test/X_test.txt (features test data) 
    5. y_test <- test/y_test.txt (test data of activities'ID labels) 
    6. subject_train <- test/subject_train (train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects) 
    7. x_train <- test/X_train.txt (features train data) 
    8. y_train <- test/y_train.txt (train data of activitiesâ€™ID labels)

    -> Merges the traing and test sets using rbind() and cbind() to create one dataset
        subject <- rbind(subjectTrain, subjectTest)
        activity <- rbind(y_Train, y_Test)
